# Vogue 2024 Ready-to-Wear Analysis
This project presents an exploratory data analysis of the 2024 Ready-to-Wear collections from *Vogue Runway*. The study investigates relationships among fashion styles, designers, locations, and industry opinions, and more.

## Executive Summary

## Introduction
Hundreds, if not thousands, of fashion brands showcase their collections twice a year — in the *Fall/Winter* and *Spring/Summer* seasons. During these seasons, fashion collections are presented six months in advance to when they are released to the public for wear. With so many different brands releasing products annually, analyzing the patterns and statistics behind the two seasons presents a stimulating opportunity. 

Through sourcing data from *Vogue Runway*, this project aims to answer the following:
1. Do the most popular/common brands match the most popular/common styles? If so, does that trend follow the industry's opinion of what the popular styles are for that year or season? Do the most influential brands in 2024 lead trends or follow consumerist style trends?
2. Which brands or designers get the most coverage in *Vogue* per season? Does a look count correlate with more popular or widely referenced collections?
3. Does a specific fashion week yield more brands? Are there more looks presented in a specific fashion week? If so, what could be the reason?

## Research Question #1: Do the most popular/common brands match the most popular/common styles? If so, does that trend follow the industry's opinion of what the popular styles are for that year or season? Do the most influential brands in 2024 lead trends or follow consumerist style trends?

For some, or perhaps most, the question of whether or not brands cater to industry trends is one that manifests itself quite frequently. In Figure 1, the top 10 brands (ignoring Unknown Brand: H&M Studio, Emilio Pucci, Sachin & Babi, Cos, Cult Gaia, Alexander Wang, Area, Rokh, and Sakai) are displayed through considering their total collection count for the year. And for those brands, the styles that are prominent are — . As *Vogue* is arguably the leading fashion magazine globally, information was sourced from the magazine to discover what the most popular styles of the 2024 season were. For the *Spring/Summer* season, trends followed the Minimalist, Romantic, Bohemian, Preppy, and Tailored styles (Abbas and Fass). For the *Fall/Winter* season, Utilitarian, Gothic, Structured, and Layered styles dominated (Abbas).  However, the figure provides limited information, likely due to the scraping method failing to capture data for all brands, resulting in minimal results for various fashion styles. With that in mind, the analysis is not applicable to the industry. Additionally, due to time restrictions and the substantial execution time for scraping, no further explorations or adjustments were made to the code.
